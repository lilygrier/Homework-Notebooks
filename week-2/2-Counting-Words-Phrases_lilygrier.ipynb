    "# Week 2 - Counting Words & Phrases\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we take text corpora that we have developed, spidered, scraped, and encoded, and we find and count words, simple and parsed phrases and explore the statistical properties of those counts (e.g., word frequency distributions). Initially, we model how to search corpora for keywords or phrases. Next, we examine the distributions of terms and phrases across a corpus, and the correlation between different words and phrase counts. In order to do this effectively, we coarsely disambiguate words based of part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and normalize them through stemming and lemmatization. Next we distinguish *important* words and phrase within the corpus, and image them with Wordls! Then we calculate word frequenceis, conditional frequences (the frequency of word *shock* conditional on the presence of word *awe*), and statistically significant collocations of lengths 2 through $n$. Finally, we calculate and visualize Differences (Divergences and Distances) between the word frequency distributions from two corpora. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we shift to focus not simply on the *ideas* in a corpus, but also extracting precise *claims*. This process involves a sequential pipeline of classifying and structuring tokens from text, each of which generates potentially useful data for the content analyst. Steps in this process, which we examine in this notebook, include: 1) tagging words by their part of speech (POS) to reveal the linguistic role they play in the sentence (e.g., Verb, Noun, Adjective, etc.); 2) tagging words as named entities (NER) such as places or organizations; 3) structuring or \"parsing\" sentences into nested phrases that are local to, describe or depend on one another; and 4) extracting informational claims from those phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be introducing spaCy as a package for Computational Linguistics, and also walk you through how to use the Davies Corpora. \n",
    "\n",
    "While we wish to avoid using NLTK for heavy corpus analysis, some of its smaller functions can still be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, for final projects that draw on these tools, we encourage you to install the software on your own machines or shared servers at the university (RCC, SSRC) in order to perform these operations on much more text. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook we will be using the following packages:\n"

FINDINGS.\\n\\n    The Congress finds as follows:\\n            (1) Immigration is a Federal responsibility.\\n            (2) The Immigration and Naturalization Service does not \\n        take into custody all aliens who are unlawfully present in the \\n        United States.\\n            (3) Section 1867 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \\n        1395dd) and State laws require that, if any individual (whether \\n        or not lawfully present in the United States) comes to a \\n        hospital and the hospital determines that the individual has an \\n        emergency medical condition, the hospital must provide either, \\n        within the staff and facilities available at the hospital, for \\n        such further medical examination and such treatment as may be \\n        required to stabilize the medical condition, or, if \\n        appropriate, for transfer of the individual to another medical \\n        facility.\\n            (4) The Southwest border region is ill-equipped to absorb \\n        the expense of providing health care to undocumented aliens \\n        because it ranks last in the country in terms of per capita \\n        income.\\n            (5) The Southwest border region has been designated as a \\n        health professional shortage area under section 332 of the \\n        Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254e).\\n            (6) The unreimbursed costs associated with caring for \\n        undocumented aliens are severely threatening the financial \\n        stability of health care providers in Arizona.\\n\\nSEC. 3. REIMBURSEMENT TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL \\n              CARE RENDERED TO CERTAIN ALIENS.\\n\\n    Section 322 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 249) is \\namended by adding at the end the following:\\n    ``(d)(1) The Secretary shall establish and implement a 5-year pilot \\nprogram under which funds made available under paragraph (6) are used \\nto reimburse providers for items and services described in section \\n411(b)(1) of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \\nReconciliation Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1621(b)(1)) provided in Arizona to \\naliens described in paragraph (3), and to reimburse suppliers of \\nemergency ambulance services furnished to such aliens for which the \\ntransportation originates in Arizona (where the use of other methods of \\ntransportation is contraindicated by the alien's condition), if payment \\nmay not be made to reimburse the provider or supplier under any Federal \\nprogram or law other than this subsection (such as title XIX of the \\nSocial Security Act), any State or local program or law, any group or \\nindividual health plan, or any insurance policy.\\n    ``(2) As part of the pilot program, in a case in which an alien \\ndescribed in paragraph (3) arrived at a hospital in Arizona and the \\nhospital provided for such medical examination and treatment of the \\nalien as the hospital determined was required to stabilize an emergency \\nmedical condition (within the meaning of section 1867(e)(1) of the \\nSocial Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395dd(e)(1))), the Secretary shall use \\nfunds made available under paragraph (6) to reimburse the hospital for \\nany transportation costs paid by the hospital to return the alien to \\nthe United States border, if--\\n            ``(A) the hospital requested the Attorney General to take \\n        the alien into custody after such stabilization;\\n            ``(B) such request was denied within 24 hours after its \\n        receipt, or the Attorney General gave no response to it within \\n        such period; and\\n            ``(C) the hospital determined that discharging the alien \\n        without providing for such transportation might pose a threat \\n        to the health or safety of the alien (or, with respect to a \\n        pregnant alien, the health or safety of the alien or her unborn \\n        child).\\n    ``(3) An alien is described in this paragraph if the alien--\\n            ``(A) is not lawfully present in the United States and not \\n        detained by any Federal, State, or local law enforcement \\n        authority; or\\n            ``(B) is paroled into the United States under section \\n        212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \\n        1182(d)(5)) for less than one year in order to receive \\n        treatment for an emergency medical condition.\\n    ``(4) During the period in which the pilot program is operating, \\nthe Secretary shall submit annual reports to the Congress on its \\noperation.

The most frequent adjectives seem to be more concerned with adminsitrative matters (e.g., available, federal, eligible). The word shows many single letters (b, u, s) that have been mistakenly tokenized, but aside from that, reveals a lot of administrative language concerned with logistics such as fiscale year, date of enactment, and taxes. The only explicitly climate-related words that stand out are renewable energy and energy efficiency. This bills obviously outline specific measures to be carried out on specific dates, so the emphasis on logistics makes sense, but I'd be curious to see what linguistically separates climate-related bills from other types of bills."

Adjectives that directly proceed the word \"energy\" seemed to be in line with policies fighting climate change (e.g., clean energy, renewable energy). However, 'nuclear energy' was also mentioned, and I'd be interested to see what the relevant bill's stance is on nuclear energy. Given that the economy is often used as a justification for bills, I looked at nouns following economic and was surprised to see 'refueling,' which is itself an energy-related word (perhaps the lawmaker was trying to make a pun--or appeal to those who fear a shift away from fossil fuels will deplete the economy)."

    "The above features help us understand more about motivations behind climate/energy legislation. Knowing the context in which energy is discussed, through both noun chunks and ancestors, allows us to better understand the issues lawmakers have with current climate policies and their aspirations for what energy policy should look like. Looking for words that are the subject of what they bill wishes to 'establish' or 'support' is useful because we gain a sense of how ambitious the bills are. We see programs, boards, and tax credits as the goal of these bills. Whether a bill is passed could have to do with the amount of change it would necessitate, and these goal-related objects help us understand that. Looking at words to the left of 'fuel' in the dependency tree helps us understand a bit about whether bills are advocating for regulation (i.e., unncessary, alternative). Looking at the contexts of the word 'efficent' provides insight as to whether the bill might be making an economic justification."

The KL $f(t)$ is $ t \\text{ log } t $, while the $\\chi^2$ is $t^2-1$. KL comes from information and $\\chi^2$ from measure theory. As such, the KL divergence computes the relative entropy between two distributions--how they differ in bits, while the $\\chi^2$ whether the same statistical inferences can be drawn from them both.  \n",

Recall that $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\|Q)$ measures the amount of information loss when $Q$ is used to approximate $P$. Here, the rows are the $P$s used for calculating KL divergences, and the columns are the $Q$s. So, each cell measures the amount of information loss when the word distribution of the column text is used to approximate the word distribution of the row text. Because the KL divergence is directional, such that the divergence of $P$ from $Q$ is different from the same of $Q$ from $P$, the matrix is assymetric and contains unique information above and below the diagonal. The same is true for the $\\chi^2$ divergence."

    "These distance and divergence analyses reveal that the two bills introduced by Democrats appear most similar to one another. Both of these bills focus on creating green jobs, so that may also explain the similarities. The Republican-introduced Energy Efficient Affordable Homes Act has to do with tax breaks for those making their homes more energy efficient, so this bill does seem to be of a different variety. The Republican-introduced Hydrogen Fuel Cells bill is an appeal to invest more in the production of hydrogen fuel, a less toxic fuel that can power motor vehicles. Thus, the two Republican bills are not especially similar to one another, and our analyses (especially KS distance) picks up on similarities between the two Democratic bills and the hydrogen fuel cell bill. The Wasserstein difference best distinguishes between Republican and Democrat categories of bills. It clearly demonstrates the similarities between the two Democrat bills, and though the Republican hydrogen fuel cell bill appears more similar to either Democrat bill than to the other Republican bill, the multidimensional visualization indicates a clear dividing line between the two parties' bills. If we are concerned with distinguishing not between parties but between individual bills, the KL divergence seems to put each bill on a different 'corner' of the multidimensional plane, and thus could be a good tool to capture within-party nuances in legislation. It would be interesting to see how a larger collection of Republican and Democratic bills compare to the differences and similarities here."
